  "story.subtitle": "Discretionary trading often appears flexible — yet without structure, flexibility turns into inconsistency. Market noise influences perception, emotions distort timing, and hindsight reshapes decisions. Over time, one principle became clear: sustainable performance is not built on prediction — it is built on predefined process. This realization led to the development of a systematic framework designed to standardize decisions, remove discretion, and operate consistently across volatile market cycles.",
