  "about.story.title": "From Discretion to Defined Rules",
  "about.story.content": "In the early stages of trading, decisions often felt influenced by emotion, market noise, and hindsight bias. Over time, one principle became clear: sustainable performance is not built on prediction — it is built on structure, discipline, and repeatable processes. This realization led to the development of a rule-based framework designed to standardize decisions and maintain consistency across different market conditions.",

  "about.definition.title": "A Framework — Not a Black Box",
  "about.definition.content": "This is not a hype-driven trading bot or an opaque black-box system. It is a structured rule set built on objective market logic. Every signal is generated through predefined criteria, evaluated systematically, and executed according to strict parameters. Transparency and clarity are core principles of its design.",

  "about.philosophy.title": "Selective Execution, Not Constant Activity",
  "about.philosophy.content": "Professional trading is not about reacting to every price movement. It is about acting only when conditions align with a defined edge — and then executing without hesitation or emotional interference. The objective is not maximum trade frequency, but controlled, repeatable performance over time.",

  "about.methodology.title": "Objective Market Structure & Trend Logic",
  "about.methodology.content": "The strategy is built around structured market analysis. It evaluates trend behavior and structural shifts directly from price data, avoiding subjective interpretation. Rather than remaining rigid, the framework adapts to changing volatility and evolving market dynamics. Less discretion. More defined logic.",

Key parameters can be configured to align with individual risk tolerance while maintaining structural integrity.",

  "about.transparency.title": "Founder-Led. Accountability-Driven.",
  "about.transparency.content": "This is a focused, founder-led firm built around one core principle: long-term trust over short-term marketing. The strategy is continuously refined and monitored with direct accountability. Offering a structured system means standing behind its logic, methodology, and risk framework — transparently and responsibly.",
