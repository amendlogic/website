  "about.title": "Our Story & Philosophy",
  "about.intro": "For a long time, trading felt like a battle between intuition, emotion, and hindsight. The deeper I went into the markets, the clearer one thing became: success isn’t built on perfect predictions — it’s built on discipline, structure, and repeatable rules.",
  "about.founding": "I founded this company to turn that realization into a professional-grade solution. We don’t offer a 'black box' or a 'get-rich-quick bot.' We provide a systematic rule set that reads the market objectively and executes with precision.",
  "about.philosophyTitle": "Trading is Selective Action",
  "about.philosophyDesc": "Good trading is not about reacting to every move. It is about acting only when conditions truly align — and then following the plan without hesitation. Our goal is not maximum activity, but stable, reproducible performance.",
  "about.riskFocus": "For us, risk is more important than profit. Our system includes safeguards to limit drawdowns and reduce overtrading in unclear market phases.",
  "about.whyUs": "We deliberately chose to build a focused firm rather than an anonymous platform. We stand directly behind our strategy because transparency matters. Using this system means working with a company that prioritizes long-term trust over fast sales.",
  "about.finalThought": "Trading doesn’t have to be a guessing game. With clear rules, it becomes a profession."
